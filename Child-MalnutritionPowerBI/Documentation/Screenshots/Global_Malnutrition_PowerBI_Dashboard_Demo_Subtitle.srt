Global Malnutrition Trends: A Power BI Analysis from 1983 to 2019. This project analyzes child malnutrition indicators using an interactive Power BI dashboard.

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Understanding long-term malnutrition trends is challenging due to large and complex datasets. This project addresses the need for clear, visual, and data-driven insights.

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The dataset is originally published by UNICEF, WHO, and the World Bank, and accessed through a public GitHub repository. It covers the years 1983 to 2019.

4
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The dataset includes indicators such as stunting, underweight, wasting, income classification, and survey sample size across multiple countries.

5
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:30,000
This line chart shows year-wise trends of stunting, underweight, and wasting, highlighting an overall decline in malnutrition indicators over time.

6
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Wasting displays higher year-to-year variation compared to other indicators, indicating sensitivity to short-term health and nutrition conditions.

7
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:20,000
This bar chart highlights the top 10 countries with the highest average stunting percentages, helping identify high-risk regions.

8
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:40,000
KPI cards summarize key metrics including average stunting, underweight, wasting, and total survey sample size.

9
00:02:40,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The donut chart represents the proportional contribution of stunting, underweight, and wasting to overall child malnutrition.

10
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The matrix visualization provides country-wise comparison using conditional formatting for better interpretability.

11
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Conditional formatting uses red, orange, and green colors to represent high, medium, and low severity levels.

12
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Income classification is included to analyze the relationship between economic status and malnutrition prevalence.

13
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:05,000
In conclusion, the dashboard enables quick identification of trends, high-risk countries, and severity of malnutrition indicators.
