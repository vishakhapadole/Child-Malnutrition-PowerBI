Global Malnutrition Trends – Power BI Dashboard (1983–2019)

Project Overview  
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing global child malnutrition trends from 1983 to 2019. The analysis focuses on key indicators such as stunting, underweight, and wasting to support data-driven insights for public health decision-making.

Objectives  
- Analyze long-term child malnutrition trends  
- Identify high-risk countries  
- Compare severity across malnutrition indicators  
- Present insights using intuitive and interactive visualizations  

Dashboard Highlights  
- KPI Cards showing average stunting, underweight, wasting, and total survey sample size  
- Line chart displaying year-wise malnutrition trends  
- Bar chart ranking top 10 countries by stunting percentage  
- Donut chart representing indicator distribution  
- Matrix table with conditional formatting for severity levels
